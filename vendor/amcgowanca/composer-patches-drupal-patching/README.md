## Patching Drupal 8 core with `cweagans/composer-patches`

This package provides a work-around for the issue in which Drupal 8 core package patches, applied through the use of `cweagans/composer-patches`, does not correctly apply patches to Drupal core itself. Instead, a common symptom of incorrectly applied patches is the creation of the directories: `docroot/core/b/` or `docroot/core/core`. This appears to be the result of a `composer.json`'s specification of the `drupal/core` project's installation path being `docroot/core`. This is commonly seen in Acquia BLT (and potentially Acquia Lightning) based projects.

This Composer Plugin provides a mechanism to resolve the issue so that patches defined in a `composer.json` for Drupal core can be applied to `docroot` vs. `docroot/core` through modification of the installation path at time of pre-patch apply events that are fired through `cweagans/composer-patches` plugin. However, this ultimately warrants modifications to the Composer Patches project to allow for the modification of the `$install_path` value which can be seen through the changes outlined [here](https://github.com/amcgowanca/composer-patches/commit/2eeba8aa7ecca90b69a6c7386522635783e553cf).

#### Usage

- The project's `composer.json` file *must* specify the new repository in which the `cweagans/composer-patches` project is retrieved from. This can be done by adding the following to your `composer.json`'s `repositories` property:

```
"cweagans/composer-patches": {
  "type": "vcs",
  "url": "git@github.com:amcgowanca/composer-patches.git"
},
``` 

- Your `composer.json` should specify as a `required` package, the `cweagans/composer-patches` as the first possible package to retrieve (prior to Acquia BLT _or_ Lightning where `"merge-plugin"."replace"` is `false`). This package should have a version of `1.x-dev`.

```
"cweagans/composer-patches": "1.x-dev"
```

- Your `composer.json` should require this package, available as:

```
"amcgowanca/composer-patches-drupal-patching": "^0.0.1"
```

- Depending on your current workflow for your project, you may need to execute a "nuke" operation to rebuild your project's dependencies effectively and accurately. _Note_ that you may (and it is likely) during your first time for executing a complete `composer install` or update operation to notice that some of the defined Drupal 8 core patches no longer apply. It should be noted that these most likely did not ever apply and silently were ignored.
